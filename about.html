		<h1 id='heading'> <u>History of OBMS</u></h1>
		<p>
			The idea of starting a secondary school was conceived about fourteen years ago(1996), when it
			was discovered that most of our prospective secondary school students were roaming the streets as 
			a results of the incessant strikes embarked upon by teachers in the public secondary schools in 
			Oyo state Nigeria. Also, most of the brilliant students from Oritamefa Baptist Model School could 
			not be absorbed into International School Ibadan, because of lack of space. Many were forced to 
			travel long distances to attend the Federal Government Schools, a situation which was very risky.
		</p>

		<p>
			Oritamefa Baptist Church decided to pray about the possibility of establishing a school and God 
			answered the prayers. With the approval of the Oyo State Government, Oritamefa Baptist Model School 
			took off with 115 students, 9 teachers and three non-teaching staff on the 23rd September, 1996.
			The journey so far from the beginning was rough, the school weathered the storm and grew in 
			leaps and bounds. With the help of the Almighty, the school has withnessed an unprecendented 
			development over the last twenty-four years. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The news about the academic success of the OBMS Total Garden went round and the rush for admission 
			into OBMS began. Therefore it became imperative to establish the Ring Road Annexe in October, 2002 in 
			order to provide opportunities for qualified candidates who could not be admitted at Total Garden because 
			of limitation of classroom space.
		</p>

		<p>
			The general performance of the students in external exams-WAEC, NECO, BECE and UTME - attests to the 
			goodness of the Lord Almighty and the commitment and drive of the management and staff of the school.
		</p>
		<h2>May the Lord continue to move us forward more and more.</h2>
